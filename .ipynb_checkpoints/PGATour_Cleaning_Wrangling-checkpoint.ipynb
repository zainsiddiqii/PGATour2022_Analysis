    "## Data Info\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It looks like we have 37 columns with information about 67 tournaments and 499 players from the 2018-2022 season.\n",
    " \n",
    "    1. `hole_par` tells us whether the hole was a par 3, par 4, or par 5 (How many strokes a player needs to make on a hole to stay even with the course).\n",
    "    2. `strokes` tells us the number of strokes the player made on the hole. For example, if a player makes 6 strokes on a par 4, their score for the hole is +2, or 2 strokes over par!\n",
    "    3. `num_rounds` tells us the number of rounds the player played in a certain tournament. It usually has values of either 2 or 4 (explanation below).\n",
    "    4. `made_cut` tells us whether a player made the *cut* (1) or not (0). PGA Tour events last 4 days and the playing field is **cut** in half after the end of the 2nd day, meaning players that *made the cut* play 4 rounds, but players that do not make the cut play 2 rounds. It could be that a player was disqualified or had to withdraw during the 1st or 3rd round, but values of 1 or 3 in `num_rounds` would be rare (good to be aware of them though!).\n",
    "    5. `pos` tells us the position the player finished at the end of the tournament in `float` form, so if a player did not make the cut, it gives a `NaN` value.\n",
    "    6. `date` gives us the date (normal `yyyy-mm-dd` form) on which a certain row gives information about.\n",
    "    7. `purse` is the prize money for the tournament.\n",
    "    8. `no_cut` tell us whether a tournament had a cut or not, this information is somewhat important as most tournaments **do** have cuts, so we might want to filter these out.\n",
    "    9. `Finish` gives the same information as `pos`, but displays the information in a way familiar to golfers (CUT meaning the player didn't make the cut, Tnum meaning the player tied for num-th place.)\n",
    "    10. `sg-` means **strokes gained** and is a comparison of the player's performance with the rest of the field (Please see https://www.pgatour.com/news/2016/05/31/strokes-gained-defined.html)\n",
    "        1. `sg_putt` means strokes gained putting.\n",
    "        2. `sg_arg` means strokes gained around the green (within 30 yards of green) (the *green* is the surface where the hole is located).\n",
    "        3. `sg_agg` means strokes gained approach the green (any shot hit towards the green that is not a tee shot on a par 4 or par 5, but includes tee shots on par 3s) (a tee shot is the first shot on any hole).\n",
    "        4. `sg_ott` means strokes gained off the tee.\n",
    "        5. `sg_t2g` means strokes gained tee to green (`sg_t2g = sg_arg + sg_agg + sg_ott`)\n",
    "        6. `sg_total = sg_t2g + sg_putt`"

    "## Data Cleaning strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The naming of the columns is very inconsistent as some column names have title style while some do not, some contain underscores while some do not etc. The naming will have to be fixed. Some of the names of the columns also do not do a great job of explaining what the columns values are representing, especially for non-golfing audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The columns that contain the three letter acronyms *FDP, DKP, SDP* have to do with Draft King / Fantasy Drafts, i.e. leagues where followers of the tour can select players to be in their 'fantasy team' and see who gets the most points. This data is of little use to my analysis here as we are MOSTLY INTERESTED IN THE STATS OF THE PLAYERS THEMSELVES.\n",
    "**These columns (12) will be removed**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We have columns in the form `Unnamed: number` which only contain null values.\n",
    "**These columns (3) will also be removed**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There are 2 columns containing information about the Players name: `Player_initial_last` and `Player`.\n",
    "**This is giving us redundant information and can definitely be reduced into one column or two columns containing a forename and surname**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `pos` and `Finish` give us the same information as different data types, but it easier working with numeric data types. Whether a player ties for 2nd place or comes solo 2nd is not of much importance to us. If `made_cut` is False, then the `pos` is `NaN`.\n",
