# PGATour2022_Analysis
Analysing player and tournament stats from the 2022 season of the PGA Tour.
This project includes data cleaning and wrangling from a dataset downloaded from advancedsportsanalytics. After cleaning the data and presenting it in an appropriate form using the correct datatypes, I perform some analysis and visualisations for the data to better understand it.
