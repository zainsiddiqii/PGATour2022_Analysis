# PGA Tour 2022 Analytics
Analysing player and tournament stats from the 2022 season of the PGA Tour.
This project includes data cleaning and wrangling from a dataset downloaded from {advancedsportsanalytics.com}[Advanced Sports Analytics]. I clean the data using SQL (PostgreSQL flavour) and then do some basic exploratory data analysis as well using SQL. 
I prepare the data to make visualisations on a dashboard in Tableau {https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zain.ibrahim.siddiqi/viz/AnalysingPGATour2022Data/Dashboard1}[Tableau].
